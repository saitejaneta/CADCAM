Manual part program for Plain turning and step turning for CNC lathe.

Aim: To develop a part program for plain turning and step turning operation on CNC lathe machine

Apparatus: Desktop computer with required accessories and required specifications, CNC Train software, CNC Lathe Machine, work piece	

Procedure: 

1. The Manual part program for plain turning is:

The above two part programs are entered in the CNC Train software and the required tool and compensation details are entered and executed. Later the same programmed is loaded to the Machine control of the CNC Lathe machine and the work piece is machined. 

Precautions: 

1. Appropriate tool must be selected
2. Required compensation details must be entered exactly for correct execution of the program

Result:

The Programs are written and executed on CNC Train software and CNC Lathe Machine.
